Here is a link to my [Wiki Page](https://replit.com/@valeriewilson256/smart-num-guesser#main.py) on my Github Repository, where the code and the desciption for the create task can be found! 

The code uses iteration, selection, and object oriented programming to guess a number based off of various attributes, before iterating through a final list that it presents to the user.

My study plan is to use Khan Academy and Collegeboard videos to study the specific requirements for the Create Task. I want to spend at least 10 minutes every schoolday developing a small program that uses one of the Create Task requirements so that I'll be ready to put them all together on the day of submission.
